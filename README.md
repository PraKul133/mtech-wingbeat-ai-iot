# mtech-wingbeat-ai-iot
# Overview : 
This project presents an IoT-based intelligent system for classifying mosquito species based on their wingbeat acoustic signatures. Leveraging Deep Learning (Xception) for feature extraction and XGBoost for classification, this system aims to support vector-based disease monitoring and control efforts with real-time deployment on edge devices like ESP32 DevKit v1 WROOM.
